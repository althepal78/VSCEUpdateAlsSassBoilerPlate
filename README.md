# AlThePal78's Sass Boilerplate

Unfortunately, I couldn't change the name on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), but I have updated the product itself. This boilerplate is designed to provide a simple and flexible starting structure for Sass (SCSS) projects, giving me full control over the development process.

## Features

This boilerplate includes the following:

- An `index.html` file to serve as the entry point for your project.
- A `src` folder that contains three subfolders: `css`, `scss`, and `js`.
  - Each subfolder includes a file corresponding to its type: `site.css`, `site.scss`, and `site.js`.
- A predefined script to monitor Sass changes in real-time, allowing you to see the effects immediately and ensure that JavaScript files are properly linked.

This setup facilitates a streamlined development process, helping me—and hopefully others—maintain an organized and efficient project structure.

## Changelog

### Version 1.0.0
- Fixed minor issues, including typographical errors and incorrect file names (e.g., `app.css` was changed to `site.css`).

### Version 4.0.4
- Made simple edits, such as adding an icon for the app and adjusting the folder structure.
